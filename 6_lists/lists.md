# Lists

* Confusingly a List looks like an Array, it isn't
* Can hold any type, including functions
* Linked List data structure, expensive to retrieve items at index
* A list is made up of "cons cells" a value and a pointer `[1 | []] === [1]`
* Made up of head and tails `hd` and `tail`
* Macros for concatenation and subtraction `++` and `--`
* Cheap to pre-append values
* Expensive to look up `length`
* Sometimes a list of integers will return single quotes `[97,98,99]`
* `is_list 'abc'`
